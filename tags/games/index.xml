      <description>Departing the Undeads Wolves vs. Zombies is a shoot&amp;rsquo;em&amp;rsquo;up (shmup) where the player must pilot their aircraft and guide their fellow villagers to safety.

I thought it would be a good time to make an update to the game ten years after I made it for ludum dare 26 and celebrate the closing of my chapter working at Unity that began many years later.</description>

I figured it would be good practice to resurrect the old version (if I could.</description>
